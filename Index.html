	<p> Hello! Iam a former high school teacher trying to figure out my life. I love to cook! Well actually I don't. I just love to eat! And sometimes I enjoy making the food that I love to eat. One of my favorite cuisines is Korean! And since my bofriend likes it too, last weekend we made kimchi! It was delicious!</p>

	<p>Here's a pic of Kimichi, it's not the one I made beceause I didnt take any pictures but don't it look spicy and savory and extra yummy?!</p> 

	<p class="bio">I think it's very important to listen to music while you cook. I don't really listen to or remember words in music so I tend to listen to a lot of instrmentals. A while back, my sister introduced me to EPIC music, basically movie trailer, cinematic music. Makes me feel like I'm saving the world when I cook </p>
